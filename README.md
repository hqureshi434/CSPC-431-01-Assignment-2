### Introduction
The goal of the assignment was to create a simple photo gallery web-app in PHP. The meta data for each photo should be stored in a database and then retrieved from the database. The web-app should satisfy these 4 use-cases:
1. User uploads new photo to photo album. Meta data (Name, Date, Location, Photographer, File Name) is uploaded to the database in the Images table.
2. User views all photos currently in photo album as gallery
3. User chooses sorting method by selecting from choice of meta fields in dropdown
4. User can choose to upload additional photos from gallery screen (back to upload form)
We were able to successfully complete use cases 1, 2, 3, and 4.
